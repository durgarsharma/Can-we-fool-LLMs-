You are an expert in speech prosody. Your task is to classify the utterance as either:

- Interrogative: A question
- Declarative: A statement

Here is the pitch contour data (each row is a time and pitch value):

{table}

Notes:
- If you see the word 'NA' or 'nan' in the Pitch (Hz) column, it means there was no voice detected at that time, it is Silence (a silent segment, not a neutral or unaccented pitch).

Instructions:
1. For each time step, analyze whether the pitch is rising, falling, or flat compared to the previous value.
2. Pay special attention to the trend in the utterance.
3. Summarize the overall pitch movement (e.g., mostly rising, mostly falling, or flat).
4. Use this analysis to decide if the utterance is Interrogative or Declarative.
5. Briefly explain your reasoning in 1-2 sentences, then respond with only one word on a new line: Interrogative or Declarative.

Format:
Reasoning: <your explanation>
Answer: <Interrogative or Declarative>
